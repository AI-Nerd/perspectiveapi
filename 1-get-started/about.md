# About the API

Perspective is an API that makes it easier to host better conversations. The API uses machine learning models to score the perceived impact a comment might have on a conversation. Developers and publishers can use this score to give realtime feedback to commenters or help moderators do their job, or allow readers to more easily find relevant information.

Start using the API by creating a new Google Cloud project, generating an API key, and making your first request. Build projects using production models or explore using experimental models.

## Create tools for readers

Use Perspective to organize comments on topics that are often difficult to discuss online. The API can help you build new tools that give people control, allowing them to explore the conversation in new ways.

## Create tools for commenters

Assist authors in real-time when their comments might violate your community guidelines or may be perceived as “toxic” to the conversation. Use simple feedback tools when the assistant gets it wrong.

## Create tools for moderators

Make moderation easier with an ML assisted tool that helps prioritize comments for moderation, and create custom tasks for automated actions.
