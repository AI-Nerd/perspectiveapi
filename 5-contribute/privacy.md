# Privacy

The Conversation AI team takes your data and privacy very seriously, both in the content of your comments and the anonymization of their authors.
 
When a developer submits a snippet of text to be scored, Perspective does not request or store any information about the author of the snippet.

Developers have the option to have snippets stored by Perspective to improve future models, or can have the snippets automatically deleted after the score is returned by enabling the `doNotStore` option.

Our full privacy policy can be read on [Google's policy website](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en).
