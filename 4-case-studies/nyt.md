# The New York Times case study

The New York Times (NYT) is using artificial intelligence to curb the online harassment happening in their own comments sections. This keeps authors free to report on the truth without fear of trolls or digital attacks. Since implementing Jigsaw tools, the NYT increased the number of articles where they offer comments by more than 300 percent. That means more people can engage on their platform with news that matters to them.

## Before

In 2016, The New York Times was only able to enable comments on about 10 percent of articles. 

Theyâ€™ve invested significant resources in community moderation to ensure that their readers have a productive place to discuss all sides of an issue and connect freely over the topics that matter most, without being subjected to abuse.

But those high standards are hard to scale.

## How they use the API

They turned to Perspective to find patterns in data to spot abusive language or online harassment. Perspective scores comments based on the perceived impact they might have on a conversation. Publishers can use that information to give real-time feedback to commenters and help human moderators sort comments more quickly. And that means news organizations and content publishers can grow their comment sections instead of turning them off, and can provide their readers with a better, more engaging community forum.

Using Perspective, The New York Times was able to triple the number of articles on which they offer comments, and now have comments enabled for all top stories on their homepage.
